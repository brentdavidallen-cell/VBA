<H1><A NAME="examples"></A>Overview of Examples</H1>

<P>The <B>Examples</B> table-of-contents lists examples illustrating the most important concepts in using MicroStation's object model.  Pertinent examples
are also accessible from the <B>Examples</B> lists of the documentation pages of the types, objects, events, methods, and objects. A page's examples list may
refer to examples that appear in the <B>Examples</B> table-of-contents.  They may also refer to shorter examples that are not
mentioned elsewhere.</P>
<P>
<P>In addition to the examples in the help file, there are examples in projects distributed with MicroStation. You can find these in the
 WorkSpace\Example\Standards\Macros directory.  Here is a brief description of those examples.

<TD class=TT width=17%><B>CopyElementExample</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This example implements a simple copy command.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>DataBaseExamples</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This connects to a ODBC database.  Then it starts a locate command to allow the user
to select an element.  Once the user has selected the element, it gets the element's database linkages,
retrieves the records corresponding to the linkages, and displays the data in a ListBox.  The module modDBCommands
has the code for starting the command.  The module modDatabaseAccess has some general purpose subroutines and functions for
working with databases.  The form frmDBConnect has the code for connecting to the database.  The form frmDBLinkInfo has
the code for extracting the linkages and populating the ListBox. The class clsDBReviewCommand has the
implementation of the locate command.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>ElementPlacementExample</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This project has 7 sample commands that show illustrate different techniques for creating elements.
The module modPlaceShapeCommands has the entry points for each of the commands.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>LineStylePicker</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This project illustrates a technique for implementing a line style picker.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>MdlExamples</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>The examples in this project illustrate how to call into MicroStation's MDL functions. Many of the declarations
in this section are copied directly out of the MDL documentation which now includes possible VBA declarations for each of
the MDL functions that is available to VBA.  See the section "Calling DLL functions from VBA" in this help file for more information.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>mdl2vba</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>Illustrates how a VBA macro can use <A href="usmthGetCExpressionValue.htm">GetCExpressionValue</A> and
<A href="usmthSetCExpressionValue.htm">SetCExpressionValue</A> to access MDL functions and data. This example requires the
vba2mdl MDL example.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>NativeCodeUtilities</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This example contains a number of utility procedures that perform tasks that are commonly required by
projects that call into native code.  Many of the examples in <B>MdlExamples</B> use these utilities.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>PictureExample</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This example shows how to display an element in a form or control. This example uses
<A href="usmthGetPicture.htm">GetPicture</A> to get the image, and a control's <B>Picture</B> property to display it.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>ReadElementExample</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This example reads all of the <A href="usobjTextElement.htm">TextElement</A>,
<A href="usobjEllipseElement.htm">EllipseElement</A>, and <A href="usobjLineElement.htm">LineElement</A>
elements from the active model and changes the color of each one.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>TextExamples</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This example has a command that converts all tags, text elements, and text nodes to upper case or lower
case. It also has a command to rotate and scale text elements and text nodes. Both commands have the ability to process all of the
elements in a fence, all of the selected elements, or all of the elements in the model. The module modTextCommands has both command entry points
plus a function <B>GetElementEnumerator</B> that determines whether the command processes the elements from
a selection set, a fence, or all of the element in the model.  The form frmChangeCase has the code for changing the case
of the elements.  The form frmTransformText has the code for scaling and rotating text elements.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD class=TT width=17%><B>SmartSolid</B></TD>
<TD class=TT width=79%%>This example shows how to use SmartSolid API for VBA. We provide a new interface: <A href="usobjSmartSolid.htm">SmartSolid</A>.
The interface contains many solid modeling tools, such as generating primitive solid, boolean operation,etc.And also there is a new element type:
<A href="usobjSmartSolidElement.htm">SmartSolidElement</A>, which represents Microstation SmartSolid/SmartSurface element.
