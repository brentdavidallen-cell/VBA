<P class=RLNSR><B><A NAME="caches"></A>Pattern Matching in Find Methods</B></P>
<P class=T>The <A href="usmthFInd.htm">Find</A> and <A href="usmthFindSavedView.htm">FindSavedView</A> methods
use pattern matching similar to the pattern matching from VB. It is a simplified regular
expression matcher. The following special characters can appear in a pattern:</P>
<PRE class=CT><CODE>
      ?             Matches any single character.
      *             Matches zero or more occurrences of any characters.
      #             Matches any single digit.
      [charlist]    Matches any character in charlist.
      [!charlist]   Matches any single character not in charlist.
</CODE></PRE>

<P class=T>A charlist can include any number of discrete characters other than ]. It can also include one or more ranges, which each
comprise two characters separated by a hyphen (for example, A-Z). Note that you can test for the special characters
?, *, # and [ by including them in a charlist.</P>

<P class=T>This function differs from VB6's "Like" operator in the following ways:</P>
    <ul>
        <li>the comparison is always case-insensitive.</li>
        <li>all white space characters are treated as spaces.</li>
        <li>if an invalid pattern is given, the method does not raise an error nor otherwise signify that fact.
        It just returns <B>Nothing</B></li>
    </ul>
<P class=T>Examples:</P>
<PRE class=CT><CODE>
    "ABBBA" matches the pattern "a*a"
    "F" matches the pattern "[A-Z]"
    "F" does not match the pattern "[!A-Z]"
    "a2a" matches the pattern "a#a"
    "aM5b" matches the pattern "a[L-P]#[!c-e]"
    "BAT123khg" matches the pattern "B?T*"
    "CAT123khg" does not match the pattern "B?T*"
