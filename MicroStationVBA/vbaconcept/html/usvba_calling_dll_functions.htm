<title>Calling DLL functions from VBA</title>
<link href="/Office.css" type="text/css" rel="StyleSheet" media="screen"></head>
<body><div><h1>Calling DLL functions from VBA</h1>
<p>Visual Basic and VBA programs can use functions that are defined in native code DLLs.
This capability lets VBA programs use the Windows API.  It also lets VBA programs running
in MicroStation use MDL built-in functions.  Most VBA programs and most VBA programmers will not use this capability.  New VBA programmers should skip
this section concentrating on pure VBA instead.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: MicroStation&rsquo;s built-in functions have to execute as part of MicroStation; therefore, a standalone
VB program or a VBA program running under the control of a host outside of MicroStation, such as a Microsoft Office application,
will get unpredictable results if it attempts to use the MDL built-ins.</p>
<p>Many functions in DLLs can execute in any process. That is not true of MicroStation&rsquo;s built-in
functions. Programs that need to call MicroStation&rsquo;s built-in functions from another process
must use <b>GetCExpressionValue</b> to do so.</p>
<p>When a Visual Basic program calls a MicroStation built-in function, it is
actually using a wrapper function instead of directly using the MicroStation
built-in function. The wrapper functions are in the DLLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdbspline.dll</li>
<li>stdcons.dll</li>
<li>stdimage.dll</li>
<li>stdmdlaccessor.dll</li>
<li>stdmdlbltin.dll</li>
<li>stdraster.dll</li>
<li>stdrdbms.dll</li>
<li>stdrender.dll</li>
</ul>
<p>Previous versions of MicroStation also included stdkisolid.dll.  It is no longer available because the mdlKISolid MDL functions
have been eliminated. It is no longer needed because the SmartSolid and SmartSolidElement were added in 8.11.9.</p>
<p>VB programs cannot use the MDL built-ins directly because:</p><ul>
<li>    With 32-bit MicroStation, VBA programs can only call DLL functions that are declared as <code>__stdcall
</code>.  MicroStation built-in functions are declared as <code>__cdecl</code></li>
<li>    The VBA dispatcher does not set the current MDL descriptor. If VBA called
MDL functions directly, they would be calling functions with a random MDL
descriptor</li>
<li>Starting with MicroStation 8.12 EDIT NEEDED MicroStation uses wchar_t* and WString for string character arguments.  VBA
native code interop works best with char* making it possible for the VBA program to work with VBA String variables without
being concerned about how the native code portion handles strings. To let VBA programmers continue to use String
variables, the wrapper functions take char* arguments and convert to wchar_t* as necessary before and after calling the wrapped
functions</li>
</ul>
<p>The typical wrapper function sets the MDL descriptor to one reserved for all of VBA, converts String arguments
to wchar_t* and WString as necessary, calls the wrapped function, converts output string values back to String format,
and then restores the MDL descriptor.</p>
<p>Note, the MDL descriptor reserved for VBA has the current transform set to master units.
</p>
<div>
<h2>Declaration of a function</h2>
<p>A function must be declared within the body of a VBA program before it can be called.
The declaration states that the function is in a DLL and specifies the function&rsquo;s parameters
and return type.</p>
<div>
<a name="#declare_statement"</a>
<h3>Declare Statement</h3>
<p>There are two forms of the declare statement:</p>
<p><code>[Public | Private] Declare PtrSafe Sub name Lib "libname" [Alias "aliasname"] [([arglist])]</code></p>
<p><code>[Public | Private] Declare PtrSafe Function name Lib "libname" [Alias "aliasname"] [([arglist])] [As type]</code></p>
<p>See the section  <a href="usvba_64bit_processes.htm#changes_vba71" target="">Changes for VBA 7.1</a> for information on <code>PtrSafe</code>.</p>
<p>The Visual Basic Reference describes the <code>declare</code> statement well, but does not give all of the
information needed to decide how to declare the arguments and use return values.</p>
<p>The syntax for an argument is:</p>
<p><code> [Optional] [ByVal | ByRef] [ParamArray] varname[()] [As type]</code></p>
<p>This is the same as an argument declaration for a VB procedure. The syntax for declaring the function return type is also
the same as the syntax for a standard VBA return type. It is important to understand how the
ByVal, ByRef, and the data types correspond to C concepts. The following sections address
these topics.</p></div>
<div><h3>Simple Arguments</h3>
<p>First, consider how the base types match.  The table below shows C and Visual Basic base type equivalents:</p>
<table border="1" frame="box" rules="all">
<colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead>
<tr>
<td><b>C base type</b></td>
<td><b>Visual Basic base type</b></td>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>char</td>
<td>Byte</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>short</td>
<td>Integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>int</td>
<td>Long</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>long</td>
<td>Long</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>float</td>
<td>Single</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>double</td>
<td>Double</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><p>VB&rsquo;s user-defined types are compatible with C structures,
although it may be necessary in some cases to add padding to a UDT to make
it line up with the MDL struct. In VB, Long and Double fields always start
on a 4-byte boundary. With MicroStation&rsquo;s C structures, long fields
always start on a 4-byte boundary but double fields always start on an 8-byte
boundary.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a UDT that requires some padding to
make it line up with the MicroStation structure:</p>
<p><code>' The field <b>pad</b> is needed to force <b>width</b> to line up with the C structure</code></p>
<p><code>
  Type TextSize<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mode As Long<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pad
As Long<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width As Double<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height
As Double<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aspectRatio As Double<br>End Type
</code></p>
<p>MicroStation&rsquo;s object model provides some of the common
simple structures from MicroStation. A C DPoint3d is a VB Point3d; a C RotMatrix
is a VB Matrix3d; a C Transform is a Transform3d.</p>
<p>Declaring an argument ByRef means that it is a reference to the memory that holds the argument.
 C provides a similar capability via pointers.  A VB declaration ByRef dlbArg
as Double is equivalent to the C declaration double *dblArg.  ByVal means
only the value of the location is passed to the function.  Since the called
function does not get the address of the argument, it cannot modify the original
value.</p><p>MDL built-ins do not use structures as arguments.  If a MDL built-in
requires a structure, it declares an argument that is a pointer to a structure.
For a C declaration of a pointer to a structure, the corresponding VBA declaration
is a ByRef variable of the corresponding UDT type. For example, given the
C declaration: <code>DPoint3d *arg</code> use the VB declaration: <code>ByRef
arg as Point3d</code>.</p>
</div>
<div><h3>Pointer Arguments</h3>
<p>Many MicroStation built-ins take arguments that are pointers. Here are some of the uses of pointer
arguments. Some of these are discussed in depth later.</p>
<ul>
<li>    <a href="#dynamic_types" target="">Dynamically Allocated Types</a>: These
are types such as DgnModelRefP and DialogBox*</li>
<li>    Function pointers.  MicroStation does not work well with function pointers
from VBA.</li>
<li>    <a href="#arrays">Arrays</a></li>
<li>    Structures.  When a MicroStation built-in requires an argument that is
a structure, it uses a pointer type.  For example, DPoint3d *</li>
<li>    <a href="#optional_arguments" target="">Optional arguments</a>: If an
argument is optional, it normally is declared as a pointer. The caller can
pass in NULL or pass a pointer to the actual argument value</li>
<li>    <a href="#variable_arguments">Variable argument types</a>: For some MicroStation
built-in functions, the data type of one argument depends on the data type
of another argument. To allow this, the argument that has different types
is declared as void *.  For example, if the second argument to mdlParams_setActive
is ACTIVEPARAM_COLOR_BY_NAME then the void * represents a char *. If the second
argument is ACTIVEPARAM_TEXTWIDTH then void * argument represents a double
*.</li>
<li>    <a href="#strings">ASCII Strings</a>: These are declared as char *.</li>
<li>    <a href="#strings">Unicode Strings</a>: These are declared as MSWChar
*.</li>
</ul>
<div><a name="dynamic_types"></a><h4>Pointers for Dynamically Allocated Types</h4>
<p>For many types, MicroStation allocates and frees the memory.
Some examples are <code>MdlDesc *</code>, <code>DialogBox *</code>, and <code>
DgnModelRefP *</code>. Since VB does not have a pointer type, VB programs
have to use <b>Long</b> to represent a pointer type with 32-bit MicroStation and <b>LongLong</b> 
with a 64-bit MicroStation. VBA 7.1 introduces the type <b>LongPtr</b>.  <b>LongPtr</b> means <b>Long</b> in a 32-bit process and
<b>LongLong</b> in a 64-bit process. A progam should declare a pointer as <b>LongPtr</b>, letting the compiler handle
the translation to <b>Long</b> or <b>LongLong</b>.</p>
<p>For some of these types, MicroStation&rsquo;s object model provides hidden methods for converting
between the pointer and the corresponding object. The hidden methods in Application
are <b>MdlGetDesignFileFromModelRefP</b>, <b>MdlGetModelReferenceFromModelRefP
</b>, and <b>MdlCreateElementFromElementDescrP</b>.  DesignFile has the hidden
method <b>MdlFileObjP</b> and <b>MdlModelRefP</b>.  Element and all of the
specific element types have the methods <b>MdlElementDescrP</b> and <b>MdlSetElementDescrP
</b>.  ElementScanCriteria has the method <b>MdlScanCriteriaP</b>.</p>
<p>
This example shows how to use a <b>DgnModelRefP</b>.  The C declaration declares
that the input argument is a <b>DgnModelRefP</b>, but the VB program has to
treat this a long.  It uses the hidden method <b>MdlModelRefP</b> to get the
pointer, and passes that into <b>mdlModelRef_isTransient</b>.  Here is the
C declaration:</p>
<p><code>BoolInt                mdlModelRef_isTransient<br>(<br>DgnModelRefP
modelRef<br>);</code></p>
<p>The VB code equivalent is:</p>
<p><code>Declare PtrSafe Function mdlModelRef_isTransient _<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lib "stdmdlbltin.dll"
_<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ByVal modelRef As LongPtr) As Long<br><br>Function
IsTransient(oModelRef As ModelReference) _<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
Boolean<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim lDgnModelRefP As LongPtr<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim
result As Long<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lDgnModelRefP = oModelRef.MdlModelRefP<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result
= mdlModelRef_isTransient(lDgnModelRefP)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IsTransient
= CBool(result)<br>End Function</code></p></div><div><a name="arrays"></a><h4>
Arrays</h4><p>Visual Basic arrays and C arrays are very different.  A Visual
Basic array is a data structure that has a description of the array bounds
and a pointer to the data.  A C array just has the data.  Since the C function
wants a pointer to the actual data, a VB program should never call an MDL
built-in passing the address of the array. In most cases, it should pass in
the address of the first element of the array. The normal technique for passing
in the address is to declare the argument as <b>ByRef</b>.  This causes the
VB compiler to generate the code to pass the address of the first argument.
This example using <b>mdlRefFile_setClip</b> illustrates this.  The C declaration
of <b>mdlRefFile_setClip</b> is:</p>
<p><code>int      mdlRefFile_setClip<br>(<br>DgnModelRefP
   modelRef,<br>DPoint2d        *pts,<br>int&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nverts<br>);
</code></p><p>The VB declaration for <b>mdlRefFile_setClip</b> is:</p>
<p><code>Declare PtrSafe Function mdlRefFile_setClip _<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lib "stdmdlbltin.dll"
_<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ByVal modelRef As LongPtr, _<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef
pts As Point2d, _<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal nverts As Long) As Long
</code></p>
<p>Given a VB array declared as <code>clipbound(0 to 6)As Point2d
</code> , a call to this function would look like:</p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mdlRefFile_setClip
modelRefP, clipbound(0), 7</code></p><p>This passes the address of clipbound(0)
to mdlRefFile_setClip.</p></div>
<div><a name="optional_arguments"></a><h4>Optional Arguments</h4>
<p>Many MicroStation built-in functions support variable
arguments by using a pointer for the argument. A C program specifies NULL
if it is not supplying a value for the argument, or the address of a variable
containing the value otherwise. In Visual Basic, the standard way of passing
a pointer to an argument is to declare the argument as ByRef. In general,
this is the best approach for passing pointer arguments but it does not work
well with optional arguments because there is no way to pass NULL for a typed
ByRef argument if the argument&rsquo;s type is a UDT such as Point3d or Matrix3d.
</p><p>It is possible to pass a NULL value if the argument is declared as
a ByRef numeric type or declared as a ByRef Any.  The following example shows
2 possible declarations for <b>mdlAccudraw_optimizeForContext</b> that take
advantage of this.</p>
<p>This example is based on the C declaration for mdlAccudraw_optimizeForContext:</p>
<p><code>Public int     mdlAccudraw_optimizeForContext
<br>(<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long flags,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* => flags from accudraw.h */
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPoint3d *originP,&nbsp;/* => NULL okay (for all 5) */
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPoint3d *deltaP,&nbsp;&nbsp;/* => */
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double        *distanceP,&nbsp;/* => */
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double *angleP,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* => */
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void *orientationP&nbsp;/* => RotMatrix or DPoint3d (unit vector) */
<br>)</code></p>
<p>
All of the arguments except <b>flags</b> are pointers, so the initial inclination
is to declare them as ByRef. This results in the following declaration:</p>
<p><code>
Declare PtrSafe Function mdlAccudraw_optimizeForContext _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lib "stdmdlbltin.dll" (ByVal flags As Long, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef originP As Point3d, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef deltaP As Point3d, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef distanceP As Double, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef angleP As Double, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef orientationP As Any) As Long</code></p>
<p>That will force the compiler to check that the base
type is correct (is it a Double, Point3d, etc.) and will also force the compiler
to generate the code to pass a pointer to the value. This is safe and easy
to code, but it requires the programmer to provide a reasonable value for
each of the arguments. That may be a nuisance to the programmer. A solution
is to change the declaration to:</p>
<p><code>Declare Function mdlAccudraw_optimizeForContext1 _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lib "stdmdlbltin.dll" (ByVal flags As Long, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef originP As Any, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef deltaP As Any, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef distanceP As Double, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef angleP As Double, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef orientationP As Any) As Long</code></p>
<p>Using this technique, a VBA program can pass NULL by specifying ByVal 0. For example:</p>
<p><code>mdlAccudraw_optimizeForContext flags, ByVal 0, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal 0, ByVal 0, ByVal 0, 0</code></p>
<p>The disadvantage of using this declaration is that the compiler
catchers fewer coding errors.  With this declaration, the compiler no longer
checks the data type of the arguments passed to originP and deltaP.</p></div>
<div><a name="variable_arguments"></a><h4>Variable Argument Types</h4>
<p>The last section ignored the function&rsquo;s final argument. Depending on the value
passed in the flags argument, the final argument may be a pointer to an RMatrix
(Matrix3d) or to a DPoint3d (Point3d). The VB program can handle this by declaring
the argument as <code>ByRef orientation as Any</code> and passing the proper
kind of argument, or the VB program can handle this by supplying multiple
declarations with one declaring the last argument as <code>ByRef orientation
as Matrix3d</code> and the second declaring it as <code>ByRef orientation
as Point3d</code>.  Once again, the approach using multiple declarations is
safer.</p></div>
<div><a name="strings"></a><h4>Strings</h4>
<p>Visual Basic stores Strings as Unicode strings.  Prior to MicrStation ??? EDIT NEEDED many MicroStation functions required ASCII
strings.  These arguments are declared as char *.  Some MicroStation functions
required Unicode strings.  These arguments are normally declared as MSWChar*. Starting with MicrStation ??? EDIT NEEDED
the vast majority of the functions were changed to require Unicode strings. However, since VBA interop were better
with ASCII strings the wrapper functions still take char* arguments. The wrapper functions convert to Unicode prior to calling
the wrapped function, and convert from Unicode upon return from the wrapped function.
*. </p>
<p>Visual Basic has some automatic processing for handling a ByVal
String being passed to a native code function.  It converts the Unicode String
to an ASCII string before calling the function, and converts the string back
when the called function returns.  Therefore, a VB program can pass a ByVal
String to a function expecting an ASCII string.</p>
<p>There is no automatic conversion of a String to an MSWChar *.  Actually, no conversion is required
but Visual Basic&rsquo;s automatic conversion of ByVal String&rsquo;s gets
in the way.  No conversion is necessary, but VB converts the string. The VB
program can circumvent this by declaring the argument as ByVal Long, and using
StrPtr to get a pointer to the data in the string.</p>
<p>So far, this section has discussed the handling of <b>char *</b> and <b>MSWChar *</b> for input.
There are functions that use these types for output as well.  For example, in C, <b>mdlFile_find</b> is
declared as:</p>
<p><code>int             mdlFile_find
<br>(
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*outname,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const char     *inname,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const char     *envvar,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const
char     *iext
<br>);</code></p>
<p>The corresponding Visual Basic declaration for this is:</p>
<p><code>Declare PtrSafe Function mdlFile_find _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lib "stdmdlbltin.dll" _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ByVal outname As String, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal inname As String, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal envvar As String, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal iext As String) As Long</code></p>
<p>The function <b>mdlFile_find</b> uses the base name, environment variable, and extension to find the file.
It stores the result in the string that outname points to. It returns 0 if it successfully finds
the file.</p>
<p>The String to hold the result must be large enough to hold any string that mdlFile_find returns. The
function mdlFile_find will place a vbNullChar at the end of the C string that it places into the buffer, so
the VB program can use the location of the vbNullChar to decide how to truncate
the buffer. The typical sequence of steps to handle data returned in an ASCII
string is:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initialize a String with a large buffer.  Make sure the buffer is big enough. You will never notice if the String is way
too large, but it will be disastrous if it is too small.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call the function.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truncate the String so that everything up
to the vbNullChar is preserved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example using this approach:</p>
<p><code>Sub FindFile()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim strFullName As String
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Allocate the buffer
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strFullName = Space(512)
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Call the function
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If mdlFile_find(strFullName, "accudraw", "MS_MDL", ".ma") = 0 Then
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Truncate at C&rsquo;s end-of-string
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strFullName = Left$(strFullName, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;InStr(1, strFullName, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vbNullChar) - 1)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debug.Print "The full path is " &amp; strFullName
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End If
<br>End Sub</code></p>
<p>Handling an output buffer declared as <code>MSWChar*
buffer</code> is similar, except the VB program has to declare the argument
as <code>ByVal LongPtr</code> and it must use <b>StrPtr</b> to get a pointer
to a data area. The following example using <b>mdlModelRef_getDisplayName</b> illustrates this.</p>
<p>The C declaration is:</p>
<p><code>StatusInt mdlModelRef_getDisplayName
<br>(
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DgnModelRefP    modelRef,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSWChar              *displayName,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned
int     maxChars,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSWChar              *separator
<br>); </code></p>
<p>The VB declaration is:</p>
<p><code>Declare PtrSafe Function mdlModelRef_getDisplayName _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lib "stdmdlbltin.dll" _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ByVal modelRef As LongPtr, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal displayName As LongPtr, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal maxChars As Long, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal separator As LongPtr) As Long</code></p>
<p>This code passes a buffer to displayName. Then it truncates the string <b>mdlModelRef_getDisplayName</b> stores in that
buffer.</p>
<p><code>Function GetDisplayName(modelRef As ModelReference) As String
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim length As Long
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim dgnModelRefP As LongPtr
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'  A subsequent section will discuss the method MdlModelRefP
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dgnModelRefP = modelRef.MdlModelRefP
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'  Allocate the buffer
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;length = 2000
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetDisplayName = Space(length)
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mdlModelRef_getDisplayName dgnModelRefP, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StrPtr(GetDisplayName), length, 0
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'  Truncate at C's end-of-string
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetDisplayName = Left$(GetDisplayName, InStr(1, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetDisplayName, vbNullChar) - 1)
<br>End Function</code></p>
<p>A Visual Basic program can pass NULL for a String simply by passing <code>vbNullString</code>, any variable
that has been set to vbNullString, or an uninitialized String variable. For example, to use <b>mdlFile_find</b>
without specifying an extension, call <code>mdlFile_find strFullName, "accudraw", "MS_MDL", vbNullString</code>.
Note, <b>vbNullString</b> is not the same as the zero-length string &ldquo;&rdquo;.
 Passing &ldquo;&rdquo; passes a pointer to a zero-length buffer. Passing
vbNullString passes a NULL pointer.</p></div></div>
<div><a name="int64_arguments"></a><h3>Int64 Arguments</h3>
<p>Prior to VBA 7.1, Visual Basic did not support 64 bit integers so VBA progams used <b>DLong</b> to simulate 64 bit integers. For
example, the C declaration of <b>mdlSystem_getFreeDiskSpace</b> is:</p>
<p><code>
int             mdlSystem_getFreeDiskSpace
<br>(
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int64       *pTotalBytes,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int64       *pFreeBytes,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char        *fileSys                /* => fileSys letter */
<br>);</code></p>
<p>
The Visual Basic declaration is:</p>
<p><code>Declare PtrSafe Function mdlSystem_getFreeDiskSpace _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lib "stdmdlbltin.dll" _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ByRef pTotalBytes As DLong, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef pFreeBytes As DLong, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal fileSys As String) As Long</code></p>
<p>Here is an example using it:</p>
<p><code>Sub PrintFreeDiskSpace()
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim freeSpace As DLong
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim totalSpace As DLong
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mdlSystem_getFreeDiskSpace totalSpace, freeSpace, "D:"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print "D: Total space " &amp; DLongToString(totalSpace)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debug.Print ",  Free Space: " &amp; DLongToString(freeSpace)
<br>End Sub</code></p><p>VBA 7.1 introduces <b>LongLong</b> to represent a 64-bit integer so 
a program that will only be used with VBA 7.1 can use either <b>DLong</b> or <b>LongLong</b>.</p></div>
<div><a name="pointer_return_values"></a><h3>Pointer Return Values</h3>
<p>All pointer return values must be handled as LongPtr.</p>
<p>If the return value is one of the dynamically allocated types, then the Visual Basic program can either
leave it as a LongPtr if the program will use it as an argument to another function,
or the program can use one of the hidden Mdl&hellip; methods to get the corresponding
VBA object.</p>
</div></div>
<div><a name="copying_memory"></a>
<h2>Copying Memory</h2>
<p>Visual Basic programs that use native code API&rsquo;s sometimes need to copy memory. VBA programs
can use the function <b>RtlMoveMemory</b> to copy memory.  As with all uses
of pointers, the programmer has to decide whether to declare the variables
as <b>LongPtr</b> forcing the programmer to generate the pointer, or as <b>ByRef
</b> letting the compiler generate the address. Typically, the program will
be copying to or from an address provided by MDL. In those cases, the VB program
has to work with a pointer represented as LongPtr. Here are 2 good declarations
for that case.</p>
<p><code>Declare PtrSafe Sub CopyMemoryToVBA Lib "kernel32"  _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alias "RtlMoveMemory" _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ByRef VBALocation As Any,  _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal SourceLoc As LongPtr,  _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal length As Long)
<br>
<br>Declare PtrSafe Sub CopyMemoryFromVBA Lib "kernel32" _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alias  "RtlMoveMemory" _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ByVal Destination As LongPtr, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByRef VBALocation As Any, _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal length As Long)</code></p>
<p>If LongPtr is used for both addresses, then both the source and destination have to be declared as ByVal LongPtr. If so, then the program
can use the declaration:</p>
<p><code>Declare PtrSafe Sub MoveMemory Lib "kernel32" _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alias "RtlMoveMemory" _
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ByVal strDest As LongPtr, _<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal lpSource As LongPtr,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal length As Long)</code></p>
<p>The same program may have all 3 of these declarations.</p></div>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The project MdlExample has examples illustrating many of these concepts.</p>
<p>The module modACS has a procedure that returns information regarding the current Auxiliary Coordinate
System.  It shows how to use a function that returns strings into MSWChar
* buffers.</p>
<p>The module modSystem has a procedure ListMdlApps that dumps
a list of loaded MDL applications.</p>
<p>The module modFileOpenDialog shows how a VBA program can use the standard
MicroStation file open dialogs.  A VB program can also use the Windows Common
Dialog file open dialog boxes.  See either of the previously mentioned references
for more information on using the Windows Common Dialogs.</p><p>The module
modMline shows how a VBA program can pass an array to a function in a DLL.
 It also shows how a get a pointer to the MSElement associated with an Element
object.</p><p>The MdlExamples project has a reference to the NativeCodeUtilities
project. The module modRepresentations of NativeCodeUtilities shows how to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    Get an MSElementDescr * from an Element object</li>
<li>    Get an ElementRef from an Element object</li>
<li>    Get an MSElement * from an Element object</li>
<li>    Get an Element object from an MSElementDescr *, giving control of the
 MSElementDescr * to the Element object</li>
<li>    Get an Element object from an MSElementDescr* without giving control
of the MSElementDescr * to the Element object</li>
<li>    Get an Element object from an ElementRef and a DgnModelRefP</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The module modNativeTypes has the methods needed for converting strings, and for copying memory.
</p>
<p>
The module modViewConversions  has methods for converting between a View object and a MicroStation window handle.
