<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">  <h2>MicroStation CONNECT Edition<br>Visual Basic
for Applications</h2><p>Visual Basic and VBA are thoroughly modern object-oriented
programming environments used by both professional application developers
and casual programmers. Visual Basic is the primary development platform for
a large number of commercial products, some of which you may use on a daily
basis. Visual Basic for Applications shares most of Visual Basic&rsquo;s capabilities,
with the major exception that VBA applications cannot be compiled into standalone
executable files (.exe) or ActiveX controls. Instead, VBA programs are designed
to run within a host application such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel,
or, in our case, MicroStation CONNECT Edition. Visual Basic also has a richer user-forms
package (forms packages include controls and features for fine-tuning the
user interface of the resultant VB/VBA "program" or macro).</p>   </body>
