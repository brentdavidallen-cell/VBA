<body> <div><h1>Using the Project
Manager</h1><p>The Project Manager dialog box provides easy access to all
functions related to loading, running, and managing Visual Basic macros in
MicroStation.</p><h4>To open the Project Manager dialog box:</h4><ol>
<li>Select Drawing > Utilities > Macros > VBA Manager.<br>The Project
Manager dialog box opens.</li>
</ol><div><h2>The Project Manager Tool bar</h2><p>The Project Manager dialog
box does not have pull-down menus like most other dialog boxes in MicroStation
that manage files or settings. Instead, it has a tool bar at the top of the
dialog that gives access to most of the commands necessary to manage Visual
Basic projects and macros. Each of the tools that appears in the Project Manager
tool bar is described below.</p><div><h3>New Project</h3><p>The New Project
icon is used to create a new VBA project. When you click the New Project icon,
the Create VBA Project dialog appears, allowing you to enter the name and
location of the file that will be created to contain the new project. Initially,
the root file name is also used to name the project module in the Project
Manager dialog. It is not necessary for the project module to remain the same
as the file that contains it.</p></div><div><h3>Load Project</h3><p>The Load
Project icon is used to load an existing VBA project into the Project Manager.
When you click the Load Project icon, the Load Project dialog appears, allowing
you to select the .mvba file to load. After choosing a file, clicking the
OK button loads the contents of the chosen file into Project Manager. </p><p>
Like many other dialogs that load various files in MicroStation, a configuration
variable can be selected to set the path to choose a project file, or the
Current Working directory can also be selected from the Directory menu in
this dialog box.</p></div><div><h3>Unload Project</h3><p>The Unload Project
icon is used to unload a Visual Basic project that is currently loaded in
memory. The Unload Project icon is dimmed and unselectable until a project
is selected in the Project Manager window. Clicking the Unload Project icon
immediately unloads the selected project. If a macro in the selected project
is currently running when the Unload Project icon is selected, it is halted
before the project unloads.</p></div><div><h3>Save As</h3><p>The Save As icon
is used to duplicate the selected project to another project file, but it
does not rename the project module itself. For example, if a project module
named &ldquo;macros2&rdquo; is currently loaded in Project Manager and is
selected, and the Save As icon is chosen, another file can be created which
will then also contain a project named &ldquo;macros2&rdquo; even though the
file name will be different from the file that contained the original project.
</p></div><div><h3>Visual Basic Editor</h3><p>The Visual Basic Editor icon
is used to display the editor window and its contents. All currently loaded
projects are accessible from the editor window, so it is not necessary to
select a project from the Project Manager before clicking the Visual Basic
Editor window. Since it is not possible to create a Visual Basic project in
the editor window, any necessary project should be created or loaded before
opening the editor.</p></div><div><h3>Macros</h3><p>The Macros icon is used
to display the Macros dialog box, showing a list of all available macros in
all loaded projects. See the <a href="usvba_macrosdb.htm#macros_db">Macros
dialog box</a> for more information.</p></div><div><h3>Start Record</h3><p>
The Start Record icon is used to begin the process of recording actions in
MicroStation to a Visual Basic macro. The Start Record icon is dimmed and
not selectable unless a project is currently highlighted in the Project Manager
list of projects.</p></div><div><h3>Stop Record</h3><p>The Stop Record icon
is used to stop the process of recording actions in MicroStation to a Visual
Basic macro. The Stop Record icon is dimmed and not selectable until the recording
process has been initiated. Once the Stop Record icon is clicked, the macro
can only be changed or appended by using the Visual Basic editor.</p></div><div><h3>
Pause Record</h3><p>The Pause Record icon is used to temporarily stop the
macro recording process so that some action or command that should not be
recorded can take place. The Pause Record icon is dimmed and not selectable
until the recording process is initiated. Once the recording process has been
paused, any actions in MicroStation are not recorded to the macro. To resume
recording, click the Pause Record icon a second time.</p></div></div></div><div><h2>
Other functions of the Project Manager</h2><p>The Project Manager dialog box
also provides features for renaming projects, for adding and editing macro
descriptions, and for setting a project to autoload. These functions are described
below.</p><p>In addition, the Project Manager has a pop-up menu that appears
when a right-click takes place in the project list area of the dialog. The
items in this menu parallel the functions of the tool bar icons, or the functions
described below.</p><div><h3>Renaming a project</h3><p>The Name field in the
VBA Project Manager dialog is an editable field. This means the name of the
currently highlighted project can be edited by clicking directly on the name,
or by right-clicking, and selecting Rename from the pop-up menu. </p></div><div><h3>
Adding or editing a project description</h3><p>The Description field in the
VBA Project Manager dialog box is also an editable field. This means the description
of the currently highlighted project can be edited by clicking directly on
the description. While there is no practical limit to the length of a project
description, it is only displayed in the Project Manager dialog, which has
limited room for description display, and in a flyover tag that appears when
the pointer is moved over the description field.</p></div><div><h3><a name="autoloadingVBA"></a>Autoloading
a project</h3><p>A project can be selected to &ldquo;autoload&rdquo; when
MicroStation is opened. This makes the macros within that project available
immediately upon startup. To set a project to autoload, load the project into
Project Manager, then click the Autoload field for that project in the Project
Manager dialog box. A check mark in this field indicates the project will
&ldquo;autoload&rdquo; the next time MicroStation is started.</p><p><b>Note:
</b> A project is not automatically loaded at startup unless the file that
contains it is in a directory that is specified in the MicroStation configuration
variable MS_VBASEARCHDIRECTORIES. See <a href="usvba_configvars.htm">VBA Configuration
Variables</a> for more information.</p></div></div></body>
